# Part 2: GPU-acceleration

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of GPU-accelerated MultiNMF using Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) framework. The implementation converts the existing Python MultiNMF code to utilize Apple M1 GPU computing capabilities, providing a modern alternative to NVIDIA CUDA for GPU acceleration.

## Implementation Approach

### Design Philosophy

The implementation leverages Apple's unified memory architecture where CPU and GPU share the same memory pool, eliminating the need for explicit memory transfers between host and device. This approach differs from traditional CUDA implementations but provides equivalent GPU acceleration benefits.

### Development Process

**Technology Selection:**
Apple M1 systems do not support NVIDIA CUDA, requiring an alternative GPU computing framework. Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) through PyTorch provides equivalent functionality with several advantages:
1. Native Apple Silicon optimization
2. Unified memory architecture
3. No driver installation required
4. Energy-efficient operation

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Device Detection**: Automatic fallback system (MPS → CUDA → CPU)
2. **Matrix Conversion**: Convert NumPy arrays to PyTorch tensors on GPU
3. **Algorithm Preservation**: Maintain identical mathematical operations
4. **Memory Management**: Leverage unified memory for simplified programming

**Code Conversion Process:**
The original NumPy-based matrix operations were systematically converted to PyTorch tensor operations:
- Matrix multiplication: `np.matmul()` → `torch.matmul()`
- Element-wise operations: `np.multiply()` → `torch.mul()`
- Array initialization: `np.random.rand()` → `torch.rand(device='mps')`
- Mathematical functions: `np.maximum()` → `torch.maximum()`

### Technical Implementation

**Device Selection Logic:**
```python
if torch.backends.mps.is_available():
    device = torch.device("mps")      # Apple M1 GPU
elif torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")     # NVIDIA fallback
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")      # CPU fallback
```

**Key Optimizations:**
1. **Unified Memory Utilization**: No explicit memory transfers required
2. **Float32 Precision**: Optimal for M1 performance characteristics
3. **Contiguous Tensors**: Ensured proper memory layout for GPU operations
4. **Batch Operations**: Grouped matrix operations for efficiency
